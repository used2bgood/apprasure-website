    <h2>Why Appraisal?</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Differences in estimates are inevitable.</strong><br><br>
    Adjusters and contractors often interpret damage, scope, and repair methods differently...</p>
    
    <br><br>
    
    <p><strong>Every project is unique.</strong><br><br>
    Materials, installation method, and workmanship standards can vary widely from one project to another. Estimating a loss isn’t an exact science — even with standardized estimating tools, two professionals might arrive at different conclusions about what it takes to restore a property to its prior condition.</p>

    <br><br>

    <p><strong>AppraSure's Role.</strong><br><br>
