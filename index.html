    <h2>Why Appraisal?</h2>
    <p><strong>Every project is unique.</strong><br><br>
    Materials, installation method, and workmanship standards can vary widely from one project to another. Estimating a loss isn’t an exact science — even with standardized estimating tools, two professionals might arrive at different conclusions about what it takes to restore a property to its prior condition.</p>
    <p><strong>Differences in estimates are inevitable.</strong><br><br>
    Adjusters and contractors often interpret damage, scope, and repair methods differently. They may disagree on what’s affected, what it takes to fix it, or what it should cost — not out of bias, but because they approach the problem from different angles.</p>
    <p><strong>AppraSure's Role.</strong><br><br>
    AppraSure implements a structured, fair, and neutral process for resolving disputes about cost and scope. Our goal is to efficiently reach a resolution and avoid unnecessary delays in claim settlement. Our team is fluent in both restorative construction and estimating. We bring clarity to complex claims and strive to reach a fair, evidence-based resolution.</p>

      <h3>Every Project is Unique</h3>
      <p>No two claims are alike. Age, materials, installation methods, and local codes all impact the scope and cost of repairs. We approach each property with a fresh, tailored evaluation — never a cookie-cutter estimate.</p>

    <!-- Why Estimates Differ -->

      <h3>Why Estimates Differ</h3>
      <p>Even with standardized estimating tools, two qualified professionals may reach different conclusions. Adjusters often focus on policy and pricing, while contractors consider practical build methods. Both perspectives matter — and both need to be reconciled.</p>

      <h3>AppraSure Bridges the Gap</h3>
      <p>Disagreements over scope, method, and cost are common. 
      We help find common ground through evidence-based, policy-compliant solutions. AppraSure combines hands-on construction expertise with in-depth estimating knowledge, giving us a unique perspective that few others can offer.
